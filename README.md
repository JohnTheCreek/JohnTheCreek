<!--
**JohnTheCreek/JohnTheCreek** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on language models, specifically morphology predicting AI models
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NLP and LLM related tasks
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any language models/NLP projects, especially if involving Japanese, English, German or Georgian. I am open for any type of project to learn from each other. 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced and complex models, preprocessing large data and feature engineering.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about language internal structure, grammar, morphology, linguistic theory.
